== Installation

[TIP]
====
To use Metanorma, normally you *donâ€™t manually install this gem*.
Depending on your setup, you may find quicker ways to get started:
please refer to https://www.metanorma.com/docs/getting-started/[Getting Started] instead.
====

To install this gem, simply run:

[source,sh]
----
gem install metanorma-cli

This will install the `metanorma` executable, which you can use with all
officially supported Metanorma flavors (such as ISO, CalConnect, IETF, etc).

However, a number of <<external-dependencies,dependencies>> are not
installed with this gem, and have to be installed separately.
The process of installing the full suite can be a little more complex.
