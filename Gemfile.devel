# Testing Gemfile.devel mechanism with isodoc PR
# This file tests that gem overrides work in CI workflow
# See docs/testing.adoc for more information

# Test isodoc PR with diagnostic message
gem "isodoc", git: "https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc", branch: "fix/test-cli-pr-testing"

# Expected output in CI logs:
# "THIS IS AN OBNOXIOUS DIAGNOSTIC"
# This confirms the PR branch is being used instead of released gem
